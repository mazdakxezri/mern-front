## installation

1. npm install --save react-router-dom@5 --save-exact

2. npm install --save react-transition-group

3. npm install -g serve --> for this command `serve` not work and I write "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" , so try `serve` again.

## explanation

--> I write the Map component but it dosen't work cuse of needs to credit card

--> For fixing style add "!important" to PlaceItem.css/.place-item\_\_content
